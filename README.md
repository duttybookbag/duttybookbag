## ❓ Common Questions

**I don't see the "Invite-Only Scripts" tab at all**
This tab only appears after you've been granted access. Make sure I have your correct TradingView username. The tab will appear automatically once access is granted — no other action needed.

**Do I need a paid TradingView plan?**
No! A free TradingView account is enough to access invite-only scripts. The paid plan requirement is only for the person *publishing* the script, not for users accessing it.

**I was added but still don't see it — what do I do?**
Try refreshing your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R), clearing your cache, or logging out and back in. If it still doesn't appear, double-check that the username you provided matches exactly what's shown on your TradingView profile.

**Can I see the source code?**
No — and that's by design. Invite-only scripts protect the source code. You can use the indicator fully on your charts, but the underlying Pine Script code remains hidden. This is a TradingView feature to protect the creator's work.

**Can I use it on mobile / TradingView app?**
Yes! Once added, your account has access across all TradingView platforms including the mobile app. If you can't find the tab on mobile, try accessing it via a browser first.
